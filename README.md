Scripts anyone is free to use (non-maliciously) for fun! :D

## fastStickman.js*
This script is for quick stickman placement. If the desired pose is not in a preset, you can modify a preset to match it!  
**Current characters:** default, hazmat, squarie (`shock` = hazmat)  
Head, torso, and hazmat customisation to be added. For now, they're just the standard `o`, `|/\`, and `l`. For <ins>l</ins>ime.
## cursorgravity.js
This script puts a gravity-like force on your cursor. It originated from [/owotchallenge](https://owot.me/owotchallenge) by e_g., then was modified so the camera could have a set "smoothness" by the creator of [/owotparkour](https://owot.me/owotparkour). By combining the updated script from the sequel of /owotchallenge, [/impossibleway](https://owot.me/impossibleway), adding the base for a TAS frame-by-frame inputter, and tick rate, I made this abomination. Enjoy!
## stickPlat.js*
I made this script originally for exploring canvas like a platformer, but now it's been repurposed for OWoT Story Mode! Development version of this script will be kept private, though.
You can change the stickman palette, like fastStickman.js.
## sounds.js
This script adds sound effects to OWoT such as when you \/warp, when a message is received, when you use a client command, and when you connect to a world using \/warp.
You can adjust the volume of these sound effects in the Menu with the mediumvioletred slider.
## writebefore_chatbar.js
This script lets you type from a pool of random characters / add colour modifications to the characters you type. Helped in making [/lime.owot/city](https://owot.me/lime.owot/city) and [/mis◌◌◌◌◌◌.](https://github.com/LimeSlime888/mis------.).
