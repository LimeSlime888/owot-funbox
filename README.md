Scripts anyone is free to use (non-maliciously) for fun! :D
## fastStickman.js
This script is for quick stickman placement. If the desired pose is not in a preset, you can modify a preset to match it!  
**Current characters:** default, hazmat, squarie (`shock` = hazmat)  
Head, torso, and hazmat customisation to be added. For now, they're just the standard `o`, `|/\`, and `l`. For <ins>l</ins>ime.
