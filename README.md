Scripts anyone is free to use (non-maliciously) for fun! :D
## fastStickman.js
This script is for quick stickman placement. If the desired pose is not in a preset, you can modify a preset to match it!  
**Current characters:** default, hazmat, squarie (`shock` = hazmat)  
Head, torso, and hazmat customisation to be added. For now, they're just the standard `o`, `|/\`, and `l`. For <ins>l</ins>ime.
## cursorgravity.js
This script puts a gravity-like force on your cursor. It originated from [/owotchallenge](https://owot.me/owotchallenge) by e_g., then was modified so the camera could have a set "smoothness" by the creator of [/owotparkour](https://owot.me/owotparkour). By combining the updated script from the sequel of /owotchallenge, [/impossibleway](https://owot.me/impossibleway), adding the base for a TAS frame-by-frame inputter, and tick rate, I made this abomination. Enjoy!
